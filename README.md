# Python for Data Analysis – Diwali Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python on a **Diwali Sales dataset**.  
The goal of the analysis is to understand customer purchasing behavior during the Diwali festival and identify key sales trends.

The project is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** and follows a step-by-step data analysis workflow, including data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation.
